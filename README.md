# Random Event Visualizer

## Overview

This Flutter project is designed to visualize random events such as coin tosses, dice rolls, and potentially other events in the future. The application provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to observe the outcomes of these random events in real-time, along with the frequency distribution of outcomes. 

I've done nothing fancy. Just simple project to visualize outcomes. 

## Features

- **Coin Toss Visualization**: View the results of simulated coin tosses displayed as a visual grid.
- **Dice Roll Visualization**: Observe the outcomes of simulated dice rolls represented graphically.
- **Slider Control**: Adjust the number of simulated outcomes using a slider control.
- **Frequency Distribution**: View the frequency distribution of outcomes in a graphical chart.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    https://github.com/kingace2056/random_event_visualizer.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd random_event_visualizer
    ```

3. Ensure you have Flutter installed. If not, follow the [Flutter installation instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

4. Run the Flutter project:

    ```
    flutter run
    ```

5. Explore the application on your device or emulator.

## Usage

1. Upon launching the application, you will see the main screen with options for visualizing coin tosses and dice rolls.

2. Adjust the number of simulated outcomes using the slider control. The outcomes will update in real-time as you adjust the slider.

3. Visualize the outcomes of coin tosses and dice rolls in their respective sections of the screen.

4. Observe the frequency distribution of outcomes in the chart displayed below the visualizations.

5. Experiment with different numbers of outcomes and observe how the frequency distribution changes.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Random Events**: Expand the application to include visualization for other random events, such as card draws, roulette spins, etc.
- **Customization Options**: Provide options for users to customize the appearance and behavior of visualizations.
- **Performance Optimization**: Implement optimizations to enhance the performance of the application, especially for a large number of simulated outcomes.
- **UI/UX Improvements**: Continuously improve the user interface and experience based on feedback and usability testing.
